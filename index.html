                <p class="muted">An enthusiast for continuous learning, I thrive on exploring new ideas and perspectives. While finance and technology are my main areas of focus, you'll often find me reading diverse recommendations, watching films, or enjoying a stgame. I see myself as someone who enjoys untangling problems creatively—whether it’s making sense of market trends or breaking down complex challenges. What truly drives me is not just figuring out how things work, but understanding why they work that way.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">What I'm Working On Currently</h3>
                    <p class="muted"> Building finance and technology enabled solutions that actually solve problems. Right now, I'm working on a few projects close to my heart: an interactive analytics dashboard that turns complex data into clear irrespective of data formats, actionable insights; a straightforward price tracker in real-time market movements; and a C2C platform that's rethinks P2P transactions through a credit-based implementation. Every project gets the same care and attention as my first—because I believe in creating practical, user-focused tools that use technology to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
